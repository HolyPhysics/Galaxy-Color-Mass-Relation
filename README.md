# Bayesian Linear Regression and Posterior Parameter Estimation for Galaxy Color-Mass Relation

The pursuance of this project is purely exploratory, stems from curiosity about the topics, and utterly feed my curiosity. It should be noted that some of these codes may appears unnnecessarily lengthy and perhaps even completely unnecessay at first glance. But, that is perfectly okay. It is okay because building this project helped reinforce what I learned in my classes and provided a scientific question, though academic, which I could take a crack at without appearting too serious and still bolster my skill. 

In this project, I explore the application of Bayesian inference and machine learning to study galaxy clusters and the underlying relationship between the masses of several disparate galaxies and their corresponding UV(UG)-color.

<!-- This project applies machine-learning classification techniques to photometric color indices derived from Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) data in order to separate quasars from stars. Multiple classifiers are evaluated and compared using ROC curves, confusion matrices, and classification reports. -->

<!-- ## Scientific Motivation

Modern astronomical surveys generate catalogs containing millions of unresolved point sources. While spectroscopy provides reliable object classification, it is observationally expensive. Photometric classification of quasars enables efficient spectroscopic target selection, large-scale structure studies, and investigations of quasar evolution and the early universe.

## Methods and Data

### Data Sources
- About 10000 Galaxy data was drawn from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey(SDSS) and accessed via astroML.table.Table

---
<!-- 
### Features
Photometric color indices constructed from SDSS ugriz magnitudes:
- u − g, g - r, r - i, i - z  -->

<!-- ### Labels
Binary classification:
- 0: Star, 1: Quasar
<!--  -->

<!-- ### Class Balancing
Equal-sized samples are drawn from each class to prevent bias due to class imbalance. --> 

<!-- ### Models Used
- Gaussian Naive Bayes
- Gaussian Mixture Model (Bayesian)
- k-Nearest Neighbors(KNN)
- Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA)
- Quadratic Discriminant Analysis (QDA)
- Decision Tree (with optimized max_depth)
- Random Forest (with optimized max_depth) -->

<!-- ### Hyperparameter Optimization
During each trainin session, cross-validation was performed on the KNN model to determine the optimal value for the _*n-neighbors*_ hyperparameter. For the tree-based model, GridSearchCV was used to performed cross-validation on the models and the _*n_depth*_ was set to the recovered _*best_depth*_ value.  -->
