# Bayesian Linear Regression and Posterior Parameter Estimation for Galaxy Color-Mass Relation

The pursuance of this project is purely exploratory, stems from curiosity about the topics, and utterly fed my curiosity. It should be noted that some of these codes may appears unnecessarily lengthy and perhaps even completely unnecessay at first glance. But, that is perfectly okay. It is okay because building this project helped reinforce what I learned in my classes and provided a scientific question, though academic, which I have been able to take a crack at and bolster my skill. 

In this project, I explore the application of Bayesian inference and machine learning to study galaxy clusters and the underlying relationship between the masses of several disparate galaxies and their corresponding UV(UG)-color.
